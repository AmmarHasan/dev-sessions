# rules for our talks

- talks need to be related to Javascript

- a talk should be of 20 minutes in length (exceptions can be made on request)

- talk can be delivered in Urdu or English (or both). The main point is to delivery the talk clearly.

- Each talk should assume there are junior and senior devs, so there should be some background given for more technical talks

- Keep the talk concise and to the point, practice the talk on your own atleast once before presenting.

- Avoid live coding unless it will explictly help show a point, have the code prepared, run it and explain how it works

- Focus on core theory principles, unique features and things you have learnt - most of the other stuff can be looked up via Google

- Talks will usually happen around 2pm on Wednesday. Make sure you are in on time, and setup your laptop 15 minutes before the talk.

- Please generate a pull request with link to your presentation / recording and updating it in Readme.md
